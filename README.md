# Ultimate Facebook Scrapper
A bot which scrapes almost everything about a facebook user's profile including

* uploaded photos
* tagged photos
* videos
* friends list and their profile photos (including Followers, Following, Work Friends, College Friends etc)
* and all public posts/statuses available on the user's timeline.

The best thing about this scraper is that the data is scraped in an organized format so that it can be used for educational/research purpose by researchers.

## How to Run 
You will need to install latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Moreover, you need to install selenium module as well using

```
pip install selenium
```

Run the code using Python 3.
The tool uses latest version of [Chrome Web Driver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). I have placed the webdriver along with the code but if that version doesn't work then replace the chrome web driver with the latest one.
